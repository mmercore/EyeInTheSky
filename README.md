Attempting to improve ground radar detection using open data SAR imagery

## Warning: Does not work, still in the "fucking around phase"

## Context

Since Harel Dan's [discovery](https://medium.com/@HarelDan/x-marks-the-spot-579cdb1f534b) of the method in 2018 and Bellingcat's subsequent [improvement](https://github.com/bellingcat/sar-interference-tracker) in  2021, the visibility of the work of ground radar operators on the C band (military G-band) has become a much rarer sight, seldom allowing the detection of an emitter on both ascending and descending orbits (events which happen 3 days appart at the equator), which is unfortunate for the monitoring of conflicts.

This repo is an attempt to improve upon the method.
